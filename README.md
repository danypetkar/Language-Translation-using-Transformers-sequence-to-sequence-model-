# Language Translation using Transformers(sequence to sequence model)
## Introduction
This project aims to provide a system for translating text from English to Hindi using Transformer-based models. Transformers have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by enabling state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as translation, summarization, and text generation.

In this project, we utilize the **Hugging Face Transformers** library to build a translation model. The system translates sentences from English into Hindi, leveraging pre-trained models such as BART, T5, or MarianMT.
## Model Description
We use the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi model from Hugging Face, a MarianMT model pre-trained for English to Hindi translation. You can explore other models or fine-tune your own based on the task requirements.
